# Adam Fast - Software Developer

Welcome! I'm Adam Fast, a passionate software developer with expertise in building scalable applications and solving complex technical challenges.

## About Me

I'm a software developer who keeps a minimal online presence.

I volunteer on the Board of Directors of DEFNA, Django Events Foundation North America, helping to organize the DjangoCon US conference.

Django is my favorite web framework, and Python my favorite programming language. I appreciate their ability to allow me to be productive quickly on new ideas and challenges.
